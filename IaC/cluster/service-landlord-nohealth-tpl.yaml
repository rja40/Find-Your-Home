# k8s yaml to deploy:
#   1 Deployment - this governs the logic (container)
#   1 Service - this opens up the logic
#   1 Service Account - this enable access control
#
# Notes:
#
# 1. the Service's .spec.ports[0] need to matches the Deployment's
#    .spec.template.spec.containers[0].ports
# 2. Deployment's .spec.template.spec.containers.livenessProbe & readinessProbe
#    can be removed to clean up the logs
#
# This script is set up for Github's newly announced (and still beta) container
# registry to side-step DockerHub's throttling of their free accounts.
# If you wish to switch back to DockerHub, replace ghcr.io with docker.io
#
# TODO: You must run the template processor to fill in the template variables "ZZ-*"
